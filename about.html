<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Orignally from Detroit, MI, I've been living in Atlanta most of my life. After high school, I moved to London,
  England to attend a fashion design school. I've never really been out of the country before but I really wanted
  to do something different, something no one else I knew was doing. In the end, I ended up back in Atlanta but
  that trip sparked my travel bug. </p>

<p>In 2018, I one an all expense paid trip to Senegal, West Africa. That trip literally changed my life. Once I
    I arrived, I realized that this is were I wanted to be. So I changed my career, learned a new skill (UX Design)
    and eventually moved to Senegal. Once there, I ended up meeting my husband, got married and now we have started
    a family, all because of that forst trip in 2018.</p>

<p>Now I'm learning a new skill and learning to code. This is my portfolio, Enjoy!</p>
